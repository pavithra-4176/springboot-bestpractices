🌱 What is Spring Boot?
         Spring Boot is built on top of the Spring Framework, which is a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications.
         While Spring itself is powerful, it often requires a lot of setup. Spring Boot solves this by:

                    Auto-configuring your application based on the dependencies you include.
                    Embedding servers like Tomcat or Jetty so you don’t need to deploy WAR files.
                    Providing production-ready features like metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration.


   🚀  Key Features of Spring Boot:

         1. Auto Configuration
              Automatically configures your application based on the libraries on the classpath.
              For example, if you include spring-boot-starter-web, it auto-configures a web server and REST controller setup.

        2. Spring Boot Starters
               Starters are a set of convenient dependency descriptors you can include in your project.
               Examples:
                    spring-boot-starter-web – for building web applications.
                    spring-boot-starter-data-jpa – for working with databases using JPA.
                    spring-boot-starter-security – for adding security features

                    
        3. Embedded Web Servers
                   No need to deploy WAR files to external servers.
                   Comes with embedded servers like Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow.
                   You can run your app with a simple java -jar command.

        4. Production-Ready Features (Actuator)
                   Spring Boot Actuator provides endpoints to monitor and manage your application.
                   Examples:
                           /actuator/health – shows application health.
                           /actuator/metrics – shows performance metrics.

                          <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
                          <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
                    </dependency>

        5. Externalized Configuration
                  Supports configuration via application.properties or application.yml.
                  You can also use environment variables, command-line arguments, or config servers.

                     app.message=Welcome to Spring Boot!

                     
                              @RestController
                               public class MessageController {
                                       @Value("${app.message}")
                                        private String message;
                                          @GetMapping("/message")
                                             public String getMessage() {
                                               return message;
                                                     }
                                                  }

   
                     

        6. Spring Initializr
                  A web-based tool to bootstrap your project quickly.
                  You can select dependencies, packaging type, Java version, and generate a ready-to-use project.

                  
        7. DevTools
                  Provides features like automatic restarts, live reload, and configurations for faster development.
                          <dependency>
                                <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
                                <artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId>
                                <scope>runtime</scope>
                          </dependency>


        8. CommandLineRunner and ApplicationRunner
                 Interfaces that allow you to run specific code at application startup.

                     @Bean
                    public CommandLineRunner demo(UserRepository repo) {
                     return args -> {
                     repo.save(new User("Kadapa Pavithra"));
                      System.out.println("User saved!");
                        };
                      }

        9. Simplified Dependency Management
                  Uses Spring Boot BOM (Bill of Materials) to manage versions of dependencies consistently.

                  
         10. Microservices Friendly
                    Works well with Spring Cloud to build distributed systems.
                    Easily integrates with service discovery (Eureka), configuration servers, and circuit breakers.
